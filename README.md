# Future-pathways-for-decarbonising-Ghana-future-energy-system
In this study, PYPSA was used to evaluate policy options for future energy systems in Ghana. A reference energy system was modelled and compared to 3 different policy options under different key indicators. This includes the total system cost, optimized generator capacities, demand-supply balance &amp; total emissions.
